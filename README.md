# Bayview Cemetery Interactive Map
This is where the source files for the Bayview Cemetery Website are hosted!

# How we did it
- We are using [Unity Engine](https://unity.com) with WebGL to accomplish this.

- To mark which plots are used, we are using the 3rd-party [Azure PlayFab](https://playfab.com) with the inventory feature. Yes, this service is meant for games, but we figured we could use it to our advantage to get this done. Plus, we can edit which plots are used remotely!

- Then, we host the code on [GitHub Pages](https://bayviewcemeterymaine.github.io/InteractiveMap) to access the HTML code from anywhere.
- Finally, on GoDaddy, our website hosting platform, we use embed code to put the build into the website!
